# Introduction
It is becoming increasingly important for Data Scientists to follow software engineering principles. However, there is no clear path for this and the internet is flooded with material that is more suited to a Data Engineer. This project aims to provide a clear path for Data Scientists to become better software engineers.

# Why should I care about Software Engineering principles?
Software engineering principles help us build robust pipelines that are easy to maintain and well-documented.
  
**They can help us reduce errors:**
- Errors can decrease the value our models are generating.
- Errors can lead to key stakeholders getting frustrated and losing trust.
- Errors can delay new projects.

**They make collaboration easier:**
- If all Data Scientists can fix the pipeline, not just the author, it is easier to plan fixes or changes.
- If all Data Scientists can maintain the pipeline, it means the author leaving the business is less disruptive.

# Project contents
Core software engineering principles have been taken and broken down into small, easy-to-understand best practices. This project can be cloned and used as a tutorial initially and then as a reference further down the line.
