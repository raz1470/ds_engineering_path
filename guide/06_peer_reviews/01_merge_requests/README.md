# Peer reviews
A peer review is a process where selected team members help review your work. The majority of the time, your work is code, and the review is done using a merge request in Git.

The rationale for peer reviews is:
- **Quality assurance** - Ensures the quality and accuracy of work by identifying errors and inconsistencies early on.
- **Error detection and reduction** - Different perspectives and a second set of eyes help catching issues that may have been overlooked.
- **Collaboration and knowledge sharing** - Collaboration across DS & AI team. Reduce risk of key personnel unavailability, ensures that another team member can step in and pick up their work.
- **Accountability and transparency** - Peer review adds accountability and promotes transparency within the team.
