# What is an IDE?
An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a program that can be used for creating, managing and running code.

**Visual Studio Code is a popular choice with the following benefits:**
- It's free
- Supports a wide range of programming languages
- You can develop and run Jupyter Notebooks (unlike the free version of PyCharm)
- It has tons of open source extensions which can be added, for more details check [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace)
- You can download VSC [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

# Extensions
The following file contains a profile with some great extensions (some of which are used in the project):

`useful_extensions.code-profile`

Once you have downloaded VSC, save the file locally, open up VSC and then navigate to:

`File -> Preferences -> Profiles -> location where you decide to save the code-profile file`
